Sample of usage Mobile Vision API from Play Services.

App count faces that are in front of camera. All working offilne. 
After first start you need to wait while play services loading model for recognition and then restart app.

Works well with Android Things 5.1. Tested on NXP imx7d with camera and display. 
Also tested with Rainbow HAT instead of display.
